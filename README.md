# Cardio_Disease_Classification

## Abstract:
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death throughout the United States. In this Dataset "Cardio Disease", We'll use it to build classification models and try to analyze and gather the insights of a dataset and predict the possibility of a person having Cardiovascular disease based on various parameters specified in this dataset.

## Data:
The cardiovascular disease dataset is found on Kaggle. Source: https://www.kaggle.com/raminhashimzade/cardio-disease

The data consists of 70,000 patient records and 14 features.

## Classification models used:
- Logistic Regression.
- K-nearest neighbors.
- Decision Tree. 
- Extra Trees.
- Random Forest.
- Gaussian Naive Bayes.
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes.

## Tools:
• Technologies:
- Python.
- Jupyter Notebook.

• Libraries:
- Pandas
